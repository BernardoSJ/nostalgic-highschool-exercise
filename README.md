# nostalgic-highschool-exercise
An old and one of the first programming exercises I did when I was in high school

This exercise only consists in:
  - Basic GUI asking 5 user their Name, Age and Height
  - The possibility to calculate the average of the age of the users until the 5 users enter their data
  - Offer the possibility to the user to show a report of the current data values of all the users
  - Offer the possibility to change a specific field (Name, Age, Height) of a specific user
